# Log your actions for performance tracking

#### Send message to slack channel and add a row describing the action and its description in google sheets, possibly improve some part of your life after analysing how you live everyday

### Update: This repo is kinda useless now since now the whole tracking is done via google apps script function which calls slack api and runs only once a day
